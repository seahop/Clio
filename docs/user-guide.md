### Tag Categories

Tags are organized into the following categories:

- **Tool**: Common red team tools (e.g., mimikatz, cobalt-strike, metasploit)
- **Workflow**: Process status tags (e.g., in-progress, needs-review, completed)
- **Evidence**: Evidence type indicators (e.g., screenshot, packet-capture, log-file)
- **Security**: Classification levels (e.g., sensitive, pii, classified)
- **Operation**: Operation-specific tags (automatically created for each operation)

### Working with Tags

**Adding Tags to Logs:**
1. Click on a log entry to view its details
2. Click the tag icon or "Add Tag" button
3. Select from existing tags or create a new one
4. Tags are immediately applied and visible on the log

**Filtering by Tags:**
1. Use the tag filter dropdown in the logs view
2. Select one or more tags to filter logs
3. You can combine multiple tags for advanced filtering

**Tag Management (Admin Only):**

### Operations and Auto-tagging

When you're assigned to an operation, your logs are automatically tagged with that operation's tag. This ensures consistent tracking across team members working on the same engagement.

## Operations Management

Operations allow teams to organize their work by engagement, project, or campaign. Each operation automatically creates an associated tag for tracking all related activities.

### For Users

1. Navigate to "My Operations" in the user menu
2. View all operations you're assigned to
3. See your currently active operation highlighted

**Setting Your Active Operation:**
1. Go to "My Operations"
2. Select the operation you want to work under
3. Click "Set as Active"
4. All new logs will be automatically tagged with this operation

**Operation Auto-tagging:**
- When you create a new log, it's automatically tagged with your active operation
- This ensures all team activities are properly categorized
- You can add additional tags as needed

### For Administrators

**Creating Operations:**
1. Navigate to Admin â†’ Operations Management
2. Click "Create Operation"
3. Enter operation details:
   - **Name**: Unique operation identifier

4. An operation tag (prefixed with "OP:") is automatically created

**Managing User Assignments:**
1. Select an operation from the list
2. Click "Manage Users"
3. Assign users to the operation:

### Collaboration
- Lock rows when making extensive edits
- Use templates for consistent logging patterns
- Add detailed notes for complex activities
- Tag logs appropriately for team visibility

### Security
